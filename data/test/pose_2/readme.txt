video number 18,28,35 and 46 was not added to the training numpy array as they generated osme error. 
This can easily be solved by just picking up another consecutive frame form the vide.

Total test videos on pose 2 -> 48

Test videos used to generate the npy file -> 44
Test videos used for actual research paper evaluation -> 20 (first 20 without including the error ones)
